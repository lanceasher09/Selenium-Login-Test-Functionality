# Selenium Login Test Functionality on Sauce Demo

This repository contains two versions of Selenium login test functionality for the Sauce Demo application. Both versions produce the same output.

## Files

- **`chromedriver_win32`**: This is the chromedriver downloaded from Selenium, specifically compatible with Chrome version build 112.
- `LoginSelenium.java`: Developed with a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
- `LoginSeleniumProper.java`: Similar to `LoginSelenium.java`, but implemented using Sauce Labs documentation methods.
